## About Me 
Graduated in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of São João Del-Rei (UFSJ) in 2021. I'am currently a Master's student in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and a member of the Neurosciences Center (NNC). Research on the implementation of microcomputers for the acquisition of neural electrophysiological signals and audiogenic models of epilepsy. I'am interested in engineering, epilepsy, electrophysiological recording, signal acquisition and treatment, neuroscience support technologies, programming and data science.

## About the Repository
The purpose of this repository is to publicize and keep some projects already completed by me within the NNC
